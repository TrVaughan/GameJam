# Plague Runner
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2021

## Theme
You play as a plague doctor who needs to save all the plague-ridden citizens before they succumb to their disease. To win, the player needs to save everyone- and they're on a very quick time limit. Nobody can be left behind, and every death matters!

## Game Play
Objective
- Save everyone before time runs out!


Game-play instructions
- WASD to move
- Space to jump
- Bats will stun you, slowing down your progress
- Touch sick people to cure them. Cure everyone to win.

## Impediments
- For some reason, GitHub merges for one of us resulted in the project being nested into itself (see commits)

## Implementation
Features
- A countdown timer
- Automatically adjusting 'lives to save' counter
- Effects for getting stunned and saving people
- Basic platforming mechanics
- Bat obstacles that can stun the player
- A game over screen complete with play again and quit buttons
- Randomized sprites for male/female sick people
